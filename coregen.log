WARNING:sim:991 - The project IP instance 'RAM_32W' for IP 'Block Memory
   Generator v7.3' was generated with a different version of the IP than is
   currently in the IP Catalog. It was originally generated using IP with the
   packaged timestamp '2012-09-17+22:14'; the IP in the current catalog has a
   different packaged timestamp '2012-11-19+16:22'. This mismatch is due to
   changes made to the IP in the user repositories. It may affect some
   functionality of the IP, if there are differences between these two versions
   of the IP.
